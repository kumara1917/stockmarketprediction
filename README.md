<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Our project employs a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and various other machine learning models to create a robust and accurate stock prediction system. By harnessing the power of LSTM, we can effectively capture and leverage historical stock price patterns, enabling us to make informed forecasts about future market trends. Our approach is data-driven and utilizes a diverse set of features and algorithms, providing a comprehensive and reliable tool for traders and investors to enhance their decision-making process in the complex world of stock market prediction.
